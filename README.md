## My process

Upon opening the index.html in my browser just to see what I was starting with, I was lost. Three weeks ago I bought a Web Dev
boot camp course on Udemy, and been learning how to code since. So with only three weeks of learning, I used any resource (Mainly MDN docs, W3, and Bootstrap docs) to get as similar as I could manage. Using chrome inspect tools to make changes quick was very useful.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- bootstrap


### What I learned

I learned that I need to more projects more often, rather than just sitting on Udemy and following along with the instructor.
At first, thought I was doing good, catching on quick. But even I knew that i'll need to start a project to show that those statements were true. But this is the BEST way to learn, is by actually putting yourself to the test.




### Continued development

I need to get more comfortable with creating cards/boxes, alignment, and could have prep before just going to war on my keyboard.
